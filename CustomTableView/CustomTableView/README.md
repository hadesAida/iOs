# My Favorites Collection

## Project Description
"My Favorites Collection" is an iOS app that allows users to display and manage their favorite items, such as movies, books, or video games. The app uses a **UITableView** to present a list of items, with custom table view cells that show the title, genre, release year, and a poster image for each item. The app uses a tab bar for navigation between different categories of items.

## Chosen Theme Explanation
For this project, I chose to display a collection of **Movies**. Each movie is represented by a custom table view cell that includes the title, release year, genre, and a poster image. The goal was to create an easy-to-navigate interface where users could browse through a collection of movies and see key details at a glance.

The theme was chosen to create a simple and visually appealing way to interact with a collection of items. In the future, this app could be expanded to include books, video games, or other types of media.

## Screenshots
